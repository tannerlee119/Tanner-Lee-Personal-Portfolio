Product Requirements Document: Personal Portfolio Website

Author: Tanner Lee

Version: 2.0

Date: August 28, 2025



1. Introduction & Vision

This document provides a comprehensive specification for the personal portfolio website of Tanner Lee. The website's primary purpose is to serve as a dynamic, professional showcase of Tanner's software development skills, projects, and experience.

The vision is to create a polished, high-performance, single-page application that not only functions as a digital resume but also communicates Tanner's personal brand: a modern, detail-oriented, and personable full-stack developer. The site will be built with a modern tech stack (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui) and deployed on Vercel.



2. Target Audience

Primary: Recruiters and Hiring Managers at tech companies. They require a fast, scannable, and impressive overview of technical capabilities and professional experience.

Secondary: Fellow developers, potential collaborators, and network contacts. They will be more interested in project details, code quality (via GitHub links), and technical skills.

3. Design & UX/UI Specifications

This section defines the website's aesthetic and interactive elements, based on the "Classic Tech (Dark Mode)" theme.



3.1. Visual Identity

Color Palette:

Background: Off-black (#111827 - Slate 900 in Tailwind). Provides a deep, focused canvas.

Text & Headings: Off-white (#F3F4F6 - Gray 100). Ensures high readability without being harsh.

Secondary Text: Light gray (#9CA3AF - Gray 400). For dates, subtitles, and less critical information.

Primary Accent: Vibrant Blue (#3B82F6 - Blue 500). To be used for all interactive elements: buttons, links, hover states, and highlights to guide the user's eye.

Typography:

Font: "Inter" (or a similar modern sans-serif). It's highly legible on screens and has a clean, neutral feel appropriate for a tech portfolio.

Headings: Semi-Bold or Bold weight to create a clear visual hierarchy.

Body Text: Regular weight for maximum readability.

Iconography: Use a consistent, clean icon set (like Lucide Icons, which integrates with shadcn/ui) for external links (GitHub, LinkedIn), project links, and skills.

3.2. Layout & Responsiveness

Structure: A vertical, single-page application with a sticky navigation bar for seamless navigation between sections.

Spacing: Generous use of white space (or "dark space") to prevent a cluttered feel and improve content focus.

Responsive Breakpoints:

Mobile (< 768px): A single-column layout. Cards, images, and text blocks will stack vertically. The navigation bar may collapse into a hamburger menu.

Tablet/Desktop (> 768px): Multi-column grids for projects and skills. Side-by-side layouts for the hero and about sections.

3.3. Micro-interactions & Animations

Goal: To enhance the user experience without being distracting. Animations should be subtle and purposeful.

Specifics:

On Scroll: Gentle fade-in and slide-up animations for sections as they enter the viewport.

Hover States:

Buttons and links should subtly brighten or change color.

Project and Experience cards should "lift" slightly (using a scale transform and a subtle box-shadow) to provide tactile feedback.

Navigation: Smooth scrolling between sections when a nav link is clicked.

4. Detailed Feature & Section Breakdown

4.1. Navigation Bar (Sticky)

Component: A clean, unobtrusive bar at the top of the viewport.

Content (Desktop): Tanner Lee (Logo/Name), About, Experience, Projects, Contact.

Content (Mobile): Tanner Lee (Logo/Name) on the left, Hamburger Menu icon on the right that opens a drawer with navigation links.

Functionality: An active state (highlighted with the accent color) should indicate which section the user is currently viewing.

4.2. Hero Section

Layout: Two-column on desktop (image left, text right), stacks on mobile.

Left Column: A professional, high-quality Avatar of Tanner.

Right Column:

<h1>: Main headline (e.g., "Tanner Lee").

Primary Button (filled with accent color): "Contact Me" (scrolls to contact section).

4.3. About Me Section

Layout: A single column with clear headings to break up the text.

Content:

Narrative: A paragraph expanding on your journey, passion for problem-solving, and mention of your study at Korea University.

Interests: A visually separate subsection, perhaps using "pills" or a small grid, to showcase your interests (Bouldering, Piano, etc.) and add personality.

4.4. Experience Section

Structure: Two distinct sub-sections with clear headings: "Technical Experience" and "Leadership & Community Involvement".

5. Accessibility

Image Alt Text: All images (profile photo, logos, project screenshots) must have descriptive alt text.

Color Contrast: The chosen color palette must meet minimum contrast ratios.

Keyboard Navigation: The site must be fully navigable using only a keyboard.

6. Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

Blog/Writing Section: A future section to host articles or blog posts to demonstrate thought leadership.

Detailed Project Pages: Clicking a project card could lead to a separate page with an in-depth case study.

Advanced Animations: Integration with a library like Framer Motion for more complex page transitions and animations.
